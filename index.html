    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm Amrutha, a 2nd year computer science MS student at UC Santa Barbara. I'm from a town called Tracy in the Central Valley. I got my BS in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science along with a Minor in Astrophysics from UC Berkeley in 2023. I'm starting research under Professor Arpit Gupta, working on network traffic classification on ESNet along with scientists at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Over the summer, I did an internship at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the Critical Infrastructure Resilience program. Over the course of 12 weeks, I explored synthetic PCAP generation using LLMs for the construction of a digitial twin of the power grid on the island of Guam.</p>
