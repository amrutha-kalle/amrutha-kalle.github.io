  <h1>Speculative Fiction</h1>
  <p>I love speculative fiction, which is broad categorization that encompasses any genre that asks "What if...?". It includes fantasy, sci-fi, horror, dystopian, and horror, to name a few. I loved reading books since I was very young, and I grew up reading mostly sci-fi and fantasy. </p>
